//   'self'  → strip when that message is FROM the account owner   (Todo/Someday: I've
//             handled it, so it drops off my action list)
//   'other' → strip when that message is NOT from the owner       (Watch/Delegated: the
//             ball is back in my court once they reply, so the waiting state clears)
//   null    → never auto-strip                                    (Reference: manual only)

// ── Mass-strip safety guard thresholds ───────────────────────────────────────
// A single transition run should only ever strip a HANDFUL of label copies — the few
// threads whose newest message just moved their state on. Removing a large fraction of an
// ENTIRE label folder in one run is never a real state change: it means the folder was
// mapped to a GTD state whose STRIP_RULE matches almost every message it holds (e.g. an
// ordinary "1: to respond" label pointed at a 'waiting'/'other' state, whose rule fires for
// every thread whose newest message is from someone else — i.e. every message you still owe
// a reply), or the periodic GTD tick has entered a re-sync↔strip loop (the tick re-fetches
// the folder from the server, then strips it again, forever). Either way, executing the run
// silently drains the folder's LOCAL rows every tick even though the mail is untouched on
// the server. So the run is vetoed per folder and logged loudly instead. Preserving live
// mail over an aggressive auto-cleanup mirrors the reconcileDeletes "incomplete search"
// delete guard. A genuine bulk transition that is vetoed simply lingers and self-heals.

// lowercase addr-spec. Account-alias routes invalidate the short-lived cache after every
// successful create/update/delete so a newly configured Fastmail masked sender is recognized
// before the next GTD transition tick evaluates a just-ingested message; a stale owner set
// would misclassify that self-sent message and strip its Watch copy for up to the full TTL.

// Watch/Delegated; Reference is never touched. Stripping a state removes that thread's
// rows from the state's designated folder via imapManager.removeMessageCopy — mirroring
// how an external labeling automation drops a label from every message in a thread at once.
//
// Loop safety: a strip deletes label-folder rows but changes no message's date or sender,
// so re-running over the same threads yields the same verdict with nothing left to strip
// — the second pass is a no-op. Drafts are excluded from recency; GTD sibling rows are
// NOT excluded, because a sibling is a copy of the same message and shares the source's
// date and sender, so it can never change the verdict (its differing row id only breaks a
// same-date tie between identical senders).
